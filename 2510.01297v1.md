## ABSTRACT

Large Language Models (LLMs) open new possibilities for constructing realistic and interpretable macroeconomic simulations. We present SimCity, a multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to model an interpretable macroeconomic system with heterogeneous agents and rich interactions. Unlike classical equilibrium models that limit heterogeneity for tractability, or traditional agent-based models (ABMs) that rely on hand-crafted decision rules, SimCity enables flexible, adaptive behavior with transparent natural-language reasoning. Within SimCity, four core agent types (households, firms, a central bank, and a government) deliberate and participate in a frictional labor market, a heterogeneous goods market, and a financial market. Furthermore, a Vision–Language Model (VLM) determines the geographic placement of new firms and renders a mapped virtual city, allowing us to study both macroeconomic regularities and urban expansion dynamics within a unified environment. To evaluate the framework, we compile a checklist of canonical macroeconomic phenomena, including price elasticity of demand, Engel's Law, Okun's Law, the Phillips Curve, and the Beveridge Curve, and show that SimCity naturally reproduces these empirical patterns while remaining robust across simulation runs.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), has enabled multi-agent simulations of human societal activities across diverse scales and domains (Gao et al., 2024a). In these settings, autonomous LLM-powered agents interact with each other and with their environment. Existing work has examined not only general social simulacra (Park et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2025; Piao et al., 2025), but also domain-specific applications such as public administration crisis (Xiao et al., 2023), health policy (Hou et al., 2025) or deduction game (Xu et al., 2025). While these work demonstrate the social simulation capabilities of LLM-driven agents, we focus on their application to the **simulation and evaluation of urban-style economic activities**.

For the past two decades, the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) framework has been the predominant paradigm for studying aggregate economic behavior (Blanchard, 2009; Glandon et al., 2023). While mathematically elegant, DSGE models the economy with fully rational agents solving explicit optimization problems in equilibrium, which restricts heterogeneity and richer behavioral dynamics (Sergi, 2018; Vines & Wills, 2020; Storm, 2021). Agent-based models (ABMs) offer a bottom-up alternative that accommodates heterogeneity but typically rely on hand-crafted decision rules (Dilaver et al., 2018). Advancing the ABM tradition with recent developments in LLMs, we propose **SimCity**, a multi-agent macroeconomic simulation framework that enables flexible, adaptive behavior with transparent natural language reasoning, and a virtual city environment that provides spatial context.

![Framework](Figure 1: The framework of SimCity)

SimCity models the economy as the interaction of four types of agents: households, firms, a central bank, and a government. To incorporate realistic heterogeneity, households and firms are instantiated as families of agents with rich variation in preferences, abilities and other background, whereas the central bank and government are modeled as single institutional agents, in line with the economic literature (Blanchard, 2025). Agents are implemented through an LLM-based module that integrates environmental observations, agent-specific traits, and structured memory to generate reasoning, planning, and decision-making.

Experimental results show that SimCity successfully exhibits a range of classic macroeconomic phenomena, such as Okun's law, the Phillips curve, the Beveridge curve, price elasticity of demand and Engel's curve. It also simulates the dynamic expansion of a city, and facilitates the simulation of novel economic shocks that were difficult to study in previous frameworks.

### Our Contributions

1. **LLM-driven macroeconomic simulation with rich interactions**: We integrate LLMs into economic simulation by modeling four distinct economic roles as LLM-driven agents, enabling realistic agent heterogeneity and rich economic interactions.

2. **Visualized urban-style simulation environment**: We provide LLM-based agents with a mapped virtual city that provides spatial context and renders the dynamics of urban expansion.

3. **Systematic evaluation**: We compile a comprehensive checklist of canonical macroeconomic phenomena and use it to demonstrate that our framework exhibits established macroeconomic patterns and generates plausible responses to exogenous shocks.

## 2. RELATED WORK

### LLMs for Social Simulation

The application of LLMs to social simulation represents an emerging and promising research frontier. LLMs are capable of exhibiting human-like behaviors (Xie et al., 2024) and can be endowed with diverse personas (Chen et al., 2024). Existing work can be broadly divided into:

1. **General-purpose frameworks**: Park et al. (2023), Tian et al. (2025), Tang et al. (2024), which aim to model general societal patterns
2. **Domain-specific applications**: Public administration crises (Xiao et al., 2023), health policy (Hou et al., 2025), financial markets (Gao et al., 2024b)

### Traditional Macroeconomic Modeling

**DSGE** models feature highly idealized decision-makers with precise mathematical objective functions, while **ABM** follows a bottom-up methodology with rule-of-thumb behavior patterns. Our work is closer to the ABM tradition but replaces predetermined behavioral rules with LLM-powered agents.

### Closely Related Work

**EconAgent** (Li et al., 2024) restricts agent-environment interactions to two simplified variables. Our work extends this by incorporating firms as LLM-driven agents, heterogeneous goods markets, enriched financial activities and taxation system.

## 3. ENVIRONMENT AND INTERACTION

Our framework consists of three core layers: environment, interaction protocol, and agents.

### 3.1 ENVIRONMENT

Each simulation step represents one month. The simulation proceeds in two phases:

1. **Phase 1 (Move-in phase)**: New households are introduced until maximum population is reached
2. **Phase 2 (Development phase)**: Population is fixed, used to study macroeconomic regularities

**Three markets**:
- **Goods market**: Firms sell qualitatively differentiated goods
- **Labor market**: Frictional matching between firms and households
- **Financial market**: Central bank accepts deposits and provides loans

We develop a web-based render module to visualize urban expansion, with a VLM determining geographic placement of new firms.

### 3.2 INTERACTION PROTOCOL

Agents interact with the environment via **function calling**. The LLMs return actions and parameters in JSON format, which are then verified and executed by the framework.

---

## 4. AGENTS

Four agent types: **households**, **firms**, **government**, and **central bank**, each simulated by an LLM.

### 4.1 HOUSEHOLDS

Households make four key decisions each period:
1. **Consumption bundle**: Minimum expenditure on essential goods
2. **Labor market action**: Job acceptance/rejection/resignation
3. **Housing choice**
4. **Financial decisions**: Saving, borrowing, or investing

Each household has heterogeneous profile: age, education, consumption preference, skill endowment.

### 4.2 INVESTMENT POOL AND FIRMS

**Investment Pool**: Uses VLM for investment decisions. When sufficient capital accumulates, a new firm is established.

**Firms**: Each produces a single good using a Cobb-Douglas production function:

$$Y_i = A L_i^{1-\alpha} K_i^{\alpha}$$

where:
- $A$ = total factor productivity
- $K$ = capital stock
- $L$ = effective labor supply

Firms decide on:
1. Quantity and price of outputs
2. Labor market actions (hiring, firing, wages)
3. Investment decisions (borrowing, capital purchase)

### 4.3 GOVERNMENT

**Macroeconomic Indicators**: Monitors GDP (nominal and real), inflation (wage and GDP), unemployment rate, Gini coefficients.

**Tax and Welfare**: Collects bracketed income tax from households and VAT from firms:

$$t_i = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k \left[ \min\{z_i, b_{k+1}\} - b_k \right]_+$$

Uses tax revenue for: public service buildings, UBI, reserves.

### 4.4 CENTRAL BANK AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM

Sets policy interest rate according to modified Taylor rule:

$$\hat{r} = \max\{r^n + \pi^t + \alpha(\pi - \pi^t) + \beta(Y - Y^n), 0\}$$

Incorporates interest rate smoothing:

$$r_t = \rho r_{t-1} + (1-\rho)\hat{r}_t$$

where $\rho = 0.8$ (smoothing factor).

#### Phillips Curve and Okun's Law

SimCity successfully demonstrates:
- **Phillips Curve**: Negative relationship between unemployment and inflation (r = -0.26, p = 0.19)
- **Okun's Law**: Negative relationship between unemployment change and GDP growth (r = -0.26, p = 0.19)

#### Beveridge Curve

Exhibits negative relationship between job vacancy rate and unemployment rate (r = -0.89, p < 0.001).

#### Further Tests

- **Engel's Law**: Food spending share decreases as income rises
- **Price Elasticity of Demand**:
  - Necessities (food/beverages): -1 < E < 0 (inelastic)
  - Luxuries (vehicles): E < -1 (elastic)
- **Investment Volatility**: Investment more volatile than consumption

### 5.2 ROBUSTNESS (RQ2)

Three experiments with different random seeds demonstrate robust regularities.

### 5.3 URBAN EXPANSION (RQ3)

During move-in phase:
- GDP steadily increases with population influx
- VLM forms clustered structure: residential areas at center, production buildings at periphery

### 5.4 CASE STUDY: EXOGENOUS PRICE IMPULSE (RQ4)

Applied 50% price shocks to 7 randomly selected goods:
- Prices gradually return to equilibrium
- Price stickiness evident in adjustment process

## 6. LIMITATIONS

1. **Abnormal Behavior**: LLM may generate aberrant decisions; heuristic checks applied
2. **Lack of Complex Financial Activities**: No bonds, stocks, or derivatives; no optimization in investing strategies
